            This year's Hackfest has a new format. The event is divided into two stages: Quals and Finals. Qualifications will consist of a range of online security tasks that will test participants' security skills in a Jeopardy style, and from this stage, only 15 finalist teams are going to compete in the Finals, which will take place on June 23rd.
